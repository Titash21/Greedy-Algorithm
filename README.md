# Greedy-Algorithm

Greedy Algorithms- A greedy algorithm, as the name suggests, always makes the choice that seems to be the best at that moment. 
This means that it makes a locally-optimal choice in the hope that this choice will lead to a globally-optimal solution.


The types of Greedy Algorithms are as follows:
  Travelling Salesman Problem
  Prim's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
  Kruskal's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
  Dijkstra's Minimal Spanning Tree Algorithm
  Graph - Map Coloring
  Graph - Vertex Cover
  Knapsack Problem
  Job Scheduling Problem
